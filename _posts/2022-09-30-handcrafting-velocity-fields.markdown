Velocity fields are used to control simulations, especially things like smoke or fluids. They can be created from any set of points by giving them a vector attribute.

It's literally that simple. Or hard --- if you don't know a few easy techniques from this article which will teach you how to direct velocity vectors by hand.



## Creating a basic velocity field
We can start by creating points. For simplicity, we'll use a simple `Points From Volume`.<br>
(Worth noting operators like `Pyro Source` have point generation built in)

We then add velocity to the points with one of the methods listed below and then we run it through `Volume Rasterize Attributes` in which we specify which attribute we want to rasterize (velocity).

This is the hardest part of creating a velocity field.

For more awareness, we can preview our velocity field a bit more clearly by feeding it into `Volume Trail` along with our original points.

Finally, we send the result into a solver. (Make sure to check out the hip file provided at the end of this post. It contains Pyro, Flip, Vellum and RBD both SOP and DOP level setups)

## How to hand-craft velocity vectors

### 1. Plane deformation method
This method relies on adding velocity in uniform direction to a plane while it's still flat, and then transforming and warping it afterwards.

![Twisting a flat plane with vectors]({{ '/assets/posts/handcrafting_velocity_fields/velfields_twist.jpg' | relative_url }}){: .img-extra-post-width}
Most SOPs will be able to deform vector attributes as long as they are of the correct type. Default attributes such as @v usually work by default, but if you chose a different name, or they simply aren't being affected by transformations then you'll have to [set attribute type metadata](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/vex/attribtypeinfo_suite) to "vector" in a wrangle.

From here, we can do pretty much anything --- duplicate the distorted plane, copy it to points in a circle, deform it along a curve using `Path Deform` --- the possibilities are endless.

### 2. Measure SOP method
If we set the `Measure` SOP to "Gradient" mode it will generate direction vectors on our geometry. We can rename the gradient attribute to "v".

![Example of Measure SOP in use]({{ '/assets/posts/handcrafting_velocity_fields/velfields_measure_example.jpg' | relative_url }}){: .img-max-post-width}

`Measure` generates these vectors in relation to the chosen axis, and they will flow around your geometry like smoke in a wind tunnel.


If we plan to deform the geometry after using Measure SOP, we will have to [change the velocity attribute's type metadata](https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/vex/attribtypeinfo_suite) to "vector" in an `Attribute Wrangle`.

### 3. Curves method
We can use curve direction as velocity. I think thatâ€™s what `Curve Force` and `Gas Curve Force` SOPs already do, but if you need it as a velocity field, this could be one way to do it.

We pass the curve through a `Resample` SOP and export a Tangent attribute and then transfer it to our velocity field.

![Example of using the tangent as direction vector]({{ '/assets/posts/handcrafting_velocity_fields/velfields_curve.jpg' | relative_url }}){: .img-max-post-width}

Alternatively, we can use `Orient Along Curve` which lets us control the rotation of @N with pitch, yaw and roll, which we then can use as @v. (`@v = @N;`)

### Transferring to velocity field

After creating the general flow of vectors we need to transfer them to our field using the `Attribute Transfer` SOP.

As always, that's just the tip of the iceberg of possibilities. There are many more ways to create and adjust velocity vectors.
